# Agri-Bot-With-Crop-Disease-Detection
Agri-Bot is an advanced autonomous robotic system designed to optimize agricultural harvesting. It has been developed to efficiently harvest crops such as cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, mushrooms, and other fruits. In horticulture, robotic systems have also been successfully implemented for harvesting citrus fruits and apples, improving efficiency and precision in the agricultural sector.

The Agri-Bot system is controlled remotely via a web server and utilizes wireless communication through Wi-Fi technology. A Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, managing both control and data acquisition. The Raspberry Pi is strategically mounted on the robot, providing easy access to all GPIO pins for rapid prototyping and seamless hardware integration.

A high-resolution camera is mounted on Agri-Bot alongside multiple sensors that monitor key environmental parameters essential for optimal crop growth. The system leverages the ThingSpeak IoT platform to collect, analyze, and visualize environmental data in real time. This enables remote monitoring and control via a web interface, ensuring efficient automation and decision-making in precision agriculture.

By integrating IoT, machine vision, and robotics, Agri-Bot enhances agricultural productivity, reduces labor dependency, and promotes sustainable farming practices.
